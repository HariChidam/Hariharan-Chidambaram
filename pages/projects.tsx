          learnedText="This was my first full-stack project on my own! I learned how to design an idea using Figma and refine it through user interviews. I also learned how to connect a frontend to a backend and utilize a database (Supabase) for storing information. Additionally, I gained knowledge in implementing authentication through Google OAuth. Now, I outline new features to be added and assist other members in implementing these changes to ensure the platform continues to be used and maintained after my graduation!"

I am now the platform lead and have learned a lot about dividing up a feature into tasks on Jira and working with a team of mixed-level engineers to build a product! I have also learned a lot about writing clean code and reusing components as much as possible. We have over 2000 users and are growing every day!"

I am currently working with the school to implement TableVision at UMich!"
          learnedText="This was my first time working with Computer Vision, and I learned a lot about the process of building a model. I learned how to use YOLOv5 and Roboflow to create and train a model and then how to deploy it using Flask and Next JS. This was my first time using Flask, and I learned how to create my own API and use it to make requests to my custom YOLOv5 model.
